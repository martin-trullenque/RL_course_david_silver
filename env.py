"""
Easy21 environment (David Silver's RL course).

State: tuple(dealer_showing, player_sum)
  - dealer_showing in [1..10] is the dealer's first black card
  - player_sum in [1..21]

Actions:
  - HIT  (1) -> draw another card
  - STICK(0) -> stop; dealer plays to 17

Dynamics:
  - Cards are 1..10. Each draw is black with prob 2/3 (adds positively),
    red with prob 1/3 (adds negatively). Initial cards are black.
  - If player's sum goes <1 or >21: player busts -> reward -1, terminal.
  - If player sticks: dealer draws until sum >= 17 (with same red/black rules).
    Dealer busts -> reward +1. Otherwise compare sums: higher wins (+1/-1), tie 0.

This is a minimal, self-contained environment with a Gym-like API:
  - reset() -> state
  - step(action) -> (state, reward, done)
  - render() -> human-readable state
